## About Me

Hello! I'm Jiayi Lu (陆家屹，he/his), and I'm a linguist. I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Dr. Julie Anne Legate. I received my PhD in linguistics from Stanford in 2024. I'm originally from [Beijing, China](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.9108518,116.3857858,18.51z?entry=ttu).

In Fall 2025, I will join the Department of Linguistics at Northwestern University, my alma mater, as an assistant professor!

## Research Interests

I'm a psycholinguist and a syntactician.

The central question of my recent and ongoing research is how linguistic input leads to changes in a speaker's knowledge and behavior (through acquisition or in-the-moment adaptation). In [my dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381157061_Linguistic_Adaptation_to_Unacceptable_Sentences), I examined the underlying mechanism of the syntactic satiation effect: the effect whereby repeated exposure to degraded sentences increases speakers' acceptability ratings for such sentences. Other related research outputs include Lu, Villata, and Sprouse (in prep), [Lu, Merchan, Wang, and Degen (2024)](https://openpublishing.library.umass.edu/scil/article/id/2125/), [Lu, Frank, and Degen (2024)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/33t7f9s4), [Lu, Wright, and Degen (2022)](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/homepage/raw/master/cogsci_submission_camera_ready%20(1).pdf), and [Lu, Lassiter and Degen (2021)](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/homepage/raw/master/cogsci21a-sub2245-cam-i9.pdf). 

In my recent work, I am examining how speakers of different languages came to acquire different syntactic knowledge from input, and how the systematic syntactic variation can be explained by a combination of the architecture of grammar, the systematic variability in the input data children are exposed to, and a learning mechanism that allows generalization from observed structures to unobserved ones. Example works include Lu, Legate, and Yang ([2025](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/homepage/raw/master/bridge_abstract.pdf), in prep), and [Lu, Papineau, Jeong, Hernandez, Goodwin, and Anttila (2025)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11JCjNFmrYNREM1NsAZlAOC1NWXfQvVLw5T58ZmTLJp8/edit?usp=sharing). 

In sum, my recent and ongoing work combines my interests in both psycholinguistics and syntax: it answers key syntactic questions about how movement and locality constraints are encoded in our linguistic knowledge, while also informing how such representations are shaped by variable linguistic input during language acquisition and in-the-moment linguistic adaptation.

In addition to the lines of work described above, I have also done research on the syntactic and information structural accounts of island effects ([Lu, Thompson, and Yoshida 2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00343); [Kim, Li, and Lu 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1059823/full); [Lu, Pan, and Degen, under review](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/008431)), the coordination structure ([Lu 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/161Gf1ljyE4PlvMR395RzCXI8l_nvTzZZ/view?usp=sharing); [Lu and Kim 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.907823/full); [Kim and Lu 2024](http://journal.kasell.or.kr/xml/39312/39312.pdf)), and theories of sentence processing ([Lu, Walenski, and Thompson 2018](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/Jiayi-Lu/blob/master/final-Chinese-Sentence-Processing_SNL2018_JL_MW_CT-V2-25lkw4h.pdf); [Kim and Lu 2021](https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/landing/article.kci?arti_id=ART002760375); [Kim and Lu 2022](https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/landing/article.kci?arti_id=ART002812645); [Zhan, Chen, Levy, Lu, and Gibson 2023](https://doi.org/10.1111/cogs.13383)).

## Me not as a Linguist
In my free time, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and watching movies. I'm also a collector of stamps, covers, and other ephemera. As a member of the American First Day Cover Society, I also create cachets (artworks on the left side of stamped covers) for first-day covers. I also love sending and receiving postcards: here is a [website](https://www.postcrossing.com/) that I use to exchange postcards with my fellow postal enthusiasts around the globe.    

I love playing and watching soccer. I am a licensed youth soccer coach (USSF E license), and I once coached the U13/14 girls team at Jahbat FC (a travel team based in Evanston, IL.) for two seasons from 2016 to 2017. [Here](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/homepage/raw/master/unnamed.jpg) is a picture of me with the team! Nowadays, I play in the local recreational league in the Bay Area as a goalie.
