## About Me

Hello! I'm Jiayi Lu (陆家屹，he/his), and I'm a linguist. I received my PhD in linguistics from Stanford in 2024. In July 2024, I will start as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm originally from [Beijing, China](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.9108518,116.3857858,18.51z?entry=ttu).

## Research Interests
I am primarily interested in psycholinguistics and syntax. 

In the domain of psycholinguistics, I'm interested in studying the linguistic adaptation effect (how do language users track and adapt to the variability in other people's grammars and their different ways of using languages?), and the nature of acceptability judgments (what do people do when they give acceptability ratings to sentences? What makes a sentence (un)acceptable? When do acceptability ratings change and why?). I have also done some work on the noisy-channel model of sentence comprehension, and the processing of relative clauses. [My dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381157061_Linguistic_Adaptation_to_Unacceptable_Sentences) is on syntactic satiation. 

In the domain of syntax, I'm generally interested in island effects. Specifically, I have looked at the argument/adjunct asymmetry in island effects, and the islandhood of conjuncts. I am also interested in the structure of clause chaining and coordination.

## Me not as a Linguist
In my free time, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and watching movies. I'm also a collector of stamps, covers, and other ephemera. As a member of the American First Day Cover Society, I also create cachets (artworks on the left side of stamped covers) for first-day covers. I also love sending and receiving postcards: here is a [website](https://www.postcrossing.com/) that I use to exchange postcards with my fellow postal enthusiasts around the globe.    

I love playing and watching soccer. I am a licensed youth soccer coach (USSF E license), and I once coached the U13/14 girls team at Jahbat FC (a travel team based in Evanston, IL.) for two seasons from 2016 to 2017. [Here](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/homepage/raw/master/unnamed.jpg) is a picture of me with the team! Nowadays, I play in the local recreational league in the Bay Area as a goalie.
